# flipper-zero-tutorial-app-cxx

This is the Object-Oriented translation of [instantiator/flipper-zero-tutorial-app](https://github.com/instantiator/flipper-zero-tutorial-app) by [Lewis Westbury](https://github.com/instantiator), but ported to **Modern C++17**.

It uses **[FlipperZero++](https://github.com/superKoder/flipperzero_plusplus)** (my OO C++ binding around the official SDK). But apart from that, it builds and installs and works the exact same way as the original.

Shout out to the original author.
